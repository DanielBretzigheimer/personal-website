  "machine-control-software-content": "Software for evaluating and configuring yarn cleaning machines. Communication with the cleaning hardware takes place via a BUS interface. Particular challenges were ensuring data security in the event of an abrupt shutdown and the weak hardware on which the software was supposed to run. For this purpose, a database developed in-house and a redundant storage system were used to ensure data integrity and good performance.",

  "database-version-management": "Database version management",
  "database-version-management-content": "When developing the <1>production data acquisition software</1>, we ran into the problem that our local test databases diverged during development and could not simply be shared with one another. To solve this problem we started to develop this tool that writes all differences that occur in the database structure in two SQL files. One file to apply the changes and one file to undo the changes. This file can then be checked in to the Git repository. Other users can import the SQL files via the tool and thus bring their database up to date. In addition, it is also possible to use the files to return to any previous version. A big advantage of the tool is that the data is retained and only the structure is updated.",

  "production-data-acquisition-content": "As a follow-up project to our <1>machine control software</1>, we received the order to develop an overlying production data acquisition system. All machines in the factory should be added and jointly evaluated and managed. For this purpose, all machines are networked with a central server, which evaluates the data received and stores it in a database. The display takes place via a separate client, which can be obtained via ClickOnce over the network. This provides access to individual and grouped machine data and settings. In addition, trends and reports can be displayed. Production can be planned for all machines at the production data acquisition system and then automatically distributed to them. Planning is carried out either using a wizard or a planning overview, in which the individual productions can be arranged in time and on the machines using drag and drop.",
  "machine-overview": "Machine overview",
  "machine-overview-content": "As part of the <1>production data acquisition</1>, an application should also be created that allows the current status of the factory to be viewed. This included the display of all machines in the factory including configured live data points. In addition, the user should be able to arrange the machines on any of the pages of the overview using drag and drop. The display should later not only serve as a start screen for the production data acquisition, but also be able to be displayed with mobile devices. Because of these requirements, we decided to implement the application as a web app with <2>GWT</2>. A particular challenge was the integration into the existing WPF application and the associated bidirectional data exchange.",

  "update-management-software": "Update management software",
  "update-management-software-content": "To distribute the <1>production data acquisition</1> (PDA), we have developed a web app with which both new and existing customers can be supplied with the software. When the application is started for the first time, all existing PDA register on the server with the data previously entered by the customer. They then connect once a day or when requested manually to exchange telemetry data and search for software updates. The telemetry data can be viewed graphically for each customer and globally via the web app. In addition, each customer can be assigned their own software version. New software versions are uploaded to the server via the web app, including changelog and compatibility matrix. The customer can use the matrix to see which of his machines are compatible with which features of the PDA. Log files can also be requested from the system via the application. After a successful upload, a previously stored email will be notified.",
  "order-management-system": "Order Management System",

This includes all master data (articles, suppliers, delivery addresses) as well as the associated requirements and orders. In order to be able to call up the application without great effort, it is made available as a web app and can also be called externally. The application automatically adapts to the screen size and can also be operated from a smartphone (responsive design). Orders can be approved directly by the responsible employees, depending on the costs and the selected project. The data required for this are taken directly from an intranet via an interface. The registration takes place via the Active Directory. There are notifications for a wide variety of events that users can configure themselves. Other features include dynamic filters, reports, imports and exports.",

The tests are then run on this instance. This ensures that all functionalities will still work after a bug fix or a new feature. We were able to significantly shorten the release cycles and concentrate on developing new functions.",
